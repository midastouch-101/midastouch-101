  <h3 class="title">Know your body type </h3>
 <img src="./img/images.jpeg" class="blog-img">
 
  <p>Every body is beautiful
<br><br>
Bodies come in all different shapes and sizes. That’s part of what makes each of us unique.
 <br><br>
It’s important to know that there isn’t an “average” or “typical” body.
<br><br>
Some of us are curvier, some of us have narrower hips or broader shoulders — we’re all a little bit different.
<br><br>
Still, most of us can categorize our shape into a few broad categories.
<br><br>
Some of the most common general categories include:
<br><br>
rectangle <br>
triangle or “pear” <br>
inverted triangle or “apple” <br>
hourglas
<br><br>
These are just a few of the different body types that you know.
<br><br>
So what are these different body types?
<br><br>
It’s important to remember that categorizing body types isn’t an exact science.
<br><br>
Oftentimes, there’s a lot of variation within one “type.”
<br><br>
You may find that your individual shape features characteristics from several of the different body types discussed below
</p>

<p>
    Rectangle, straight, or “banana”
 <br><br>
If your waist measurements are about the same as your hip or bust, and your shoulders and hips are about the same width, you have what’s called a “banana” or rectangle body type.
<br><br>
Stylists will probably point you toward off-the-shoulder tops, tube dresses, and belted waists.
<br><br>
Triangle or “pear”
<br><br>
With this shape, your shoulders and bust are narrower than your hips.
<br><br>
You probably have slim arms and a fairly defined waist. Your waist most likely slopes out to your hips.
<br><br>
Stylists often recommend clothing that shows off the waistline.
<br><br>
Spoon
<br><br>
The spoon body type is pretty similar to the triangle or “pear” shape.
<br><br>
Your hips are larger than your bust or the rest of your body and may have a “shelf”-like appearance.
<br><br>
You likely have a defined waist. You may also carry some weight in your upper arms and upper thighs.
<br><br>
You may be told to look for dresses that have classic “baby doll” cuts or other items with an empire waist.
<br><br>
Hourglass
<br><br>
If your hips and bust are nearly equal in size and you have a well-defined waist that’s narrower than both, you have an hourglass shape.
<br><br>
Your legs and upper body are probably considered proportionate.
<br><br>
Your shoulders may be slightly rounded, and you most likely have a rounded buttocks.
<br><br>
Form-fitting or tailored clothing have traditionally been designed with this body type in mind.
<br><br>
Top hourglass
<br><br>
As a top hourglass, you have the general hourglass shape, but your bust measurements are slightly larger than your hips.
<br><br>
Boot cut or slightly flared pants probably fit you well, as do full or A-line skirts and tailored jackets.
<br><br>
Now that you know your body type and best style for you, choose a befitting style for yourself or loved ones
